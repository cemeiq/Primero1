The steps below explain on how to use the Primero App.

1. Log onto the [http://iqragsoc.com/iqragsoc.com/primero](http://iqragsoc.com/iqragsoc.com/primero) or open the android/kindle app

2. You will see a blue Primero loader. 

3. The loader will disappear after a few seconds and it will be redirected to the main page of primero app.

4. You will see icons on the homepage of Primero. Each of these icons lead to an activity.

5. You can hover your mouse on any of these icons. On hovering, you will see a green  button. The green button will start a new activity.

6. The first activity in the grid is the maze activity. The maze activity featured on Primero  lets users navigate the smiley face to the end of the maze. The levels become more difficult as game proceeds. If you wish to exit an existing activity, such as this one, simply click on the red button on the upper right hand side of the screen – you will be immediately taken to the home screen of the application.

7. The activity next to maze icon is the paint activity. The paint activity in Primero can be used to create artistic pieces using the draw, fill and color features. If you wish to resume your last session of the activity, click on the red button to return to the home screen. When you wish to resume your session, hover your cursor over the desired logo and click on the yellow circle. This will allow you to resume your activity where you left off.

8. Move your cursor to the third activity icon.The third activity featured in Primero is the Tamtam microactivity. It can be used to learn about different sound-picture associations. To select a sound category, click on the pink button of your choice. To listen to a sound clip, simply click on the desired purple button.

9. Let us now look at the Reflection activity. You can find it by moving your cursor to the fourth activity icon. The end goal is to edit the colours of all circles on both sides of the game until they are completely symmetrical. Select the reflection activity from the black bar found on the top of the application page. To change the colour of any circle, simply click until your desired colour.

10. The next activity icon are purple colored blocks. This is memorize activity. The memorize activity allows users to match identical tiles from the selection provided. To look at a tile, click on it. You can only look at 1 tile from Group 1 or 2 at the same time.

For Chrome, close ALL running instances of Chrome and re-launch it using the command line:

chrome --allow-file-access-from-files index.html

On Mac OS, you should launch:

open -n /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --args --allow-file-access-from-files

## Addendum for ios App

Please follow the following steps for the development of an ios app.

## **1.Installing the Requirements**

### Xcode

## There are two ways to download Xcode:

* from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12), available by searching for "Xcode" in the App Store application.

* from [Apple Developer Downloads](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action), which requires registration as an Apple Developer.

## Once Xcode is installed, several command-line tools need to be enabled for Cordova to run. From the command line, run:

## $ xcode-select --install

## **2. Installing Cordova**

Cordova command-line runs on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and is available on [NPM](https://npmjs.org/package/cordova). Follow [platform specific guides](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/index.html#develop-for-platforms) to install additional platform dependencies. Open a command prompt or Terminal, and type npm install -g cordova.

Copy

$ npm install -g cordova

npm install -g cordova

## **3. Create a project**

Create a blank Cordova project using the command-line tool. Navigate to the directory where you wish to create your project and type cordova create <path>.

For a complete set of options, type cordova help create.

Copy

$ cordova create MyApp

cordova create MyApp

**4. ****Add a platform**

After creating a Cordova project, navigate to the project directory. From the project directory, you need to add a platform for which you want to build your app.

1. To add a platform, type cordova platform add <platform name>.

2. For a complete list of platforms you can add, run cordova platform.

$ cd MyApp

$ cordova platform add ios

cd MyApp cordova platform add ios

## **5. Run your app**
